This is a simple script to help us (well, me) remove spam from the
OpenHatch forum, which runs Vanilla.

It's based on the notion that once a user posts a single piece of very
spammy text, they are a bad actor and ought to be removed from the
system entirely.

You'll also need a web browser logged into the forum as an admin.

This is the recommended way to run it:

* cd into this directory, then from a terminal, run

* ipython

Inside ipython, do:

%edit find_spam_users.py

and save and exit the editor. Now, you have some functions available.

To remove spam from the site, run this until you find no spam:

 bad = in_feed_look_for_spammy_users(get_feed())
 make_deletion_urls(bad)

The last line will print URLs for you to visit on the web. Go visit
the URLs, and click that you agree, and those bad users and their
content will be deleted.
